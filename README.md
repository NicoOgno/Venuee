# Venuee

Venuee was created as a response to the need in the market for convenient event space booking. This new product takes the long process of reaching out to multiple venues separately to find the right date and price, and instead puts all matches from your search in one place. Vendors and users can utilize the in-chat feature, update their profile settings, and easily book a venue with the click of a button.

## Getting Started
### Frontend
- Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine
- Change directory into client folder
- Add your credentials to your .env file, following the example in .env.example
- To install dependencies, run:
```npm install```
- After dependencies have been installed, start the client:
```npm start```
### Backend
- Change directory into server folder
- Following the example in .env.example, add your credentials to your .env file
- To install the backend dependencies, run:
```npm install```
- Run the seed file to populate the database with filler data:
```node seed```
- Start the server:
```nodemon --> starts the node express server```
### Database
- We used pgAdmin4 as our orm
- Add your pgAdmin4 username and password to your backend .env file
- The database will automatically be connected when you start the server
- note - you can change the sync.force property in the server's index.js with these options:
When 'false', the 'nodemon' command will add the seed data to any data already existing in the database.
When 'true', the 'nodemon' command will delete everything in the database, and then add the seed data to the empty database.
